# Synopsis
Short for: Tribulation Library. This is a library of shared code between 
the True Human Tribulation games, and other such projects. 

The idea is that since I've already did all that setup the first time when 
making Skirmish, I might as well streamline the process for future games 
by making a shared library. 

In other words, this library is more for me, than you. I just thought it
would be nice to make it open-source for everyone to see. Maybe you could
find some use for it.
