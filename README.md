# Synopsis
This is a library of shared code between various projects made by me.
(ei: Games for the True Human Tribulation series for the most part.) The 
idea is that since I've already did all that setup the first time when
making Skirmish, I might as well streamline the process for future games
by making a shared library. So this library is more for me, than you.
